# Symbolic Differentiator
A program that takes in any mathematical expression through a command line interface (CLI) and symbolically differentiates it.

The difference between symbolical and numerical differentation is that the former is exact and solves the problem for an infinite number of values at the same time. Numerical differentiation can only differentiate for specific inputs at a time, and is approximate in nature.
